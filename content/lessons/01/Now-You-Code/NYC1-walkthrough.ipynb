    "At first, there is no change when I enter 'TWO' instead of '2', but there is a change in result when I enter $60 instead of 60. Change is that next code doest not work. Code cannot calculate contribution of each person from since adding a character $ to 60. \n",
    "2. Why do you think this happens? \n",
    "I think that we need to synthesize measurements to use calculate correctly. $60 and 60 is different and number and number with diffrent measurements of Python is different.  \n",

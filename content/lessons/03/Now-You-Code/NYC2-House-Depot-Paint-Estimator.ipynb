    "The big-box hardware store *House Depot* as contracted you to write an App to estimate the amount of paint required to paint a room. Given that 1 gallon of paint covers 400 square feet, you must output the number of paint cans required to paint a rectangular room.\n",

    "- the width of the room in feet,\n",

    "The program should output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- total area to be painted ( sum of each of the 4 walls)\n",
    "- the number of gallons of paint required to paint the room.\n",

    "2. Does the output make sense when you enter a negative length? Why type of error is this?\n",
    "1. No, output does not make a sense because it changes type to positive value during calculation. This is logical error which program has not error, but user input is wrong \n",
    "3. Why do we use `math.ceil()` in this program? In other words are you allowed to buy 3.75 gallons of paint?\n",
    "1. We use 'math.ceil()' to round up the value to the nearest upper whole number and this helps to calculate problem to round up.\n"

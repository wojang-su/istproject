    "- Premium quality paint is `$32.99` per gallon.\n",

    "In addition if the customer wants computerized color-matching that incurs an additional fee of `$4.99` per gallon. \n",

    "2. What happens when you enter something other than `'y'` or `'n'` for color matching? Re-write the program to print `you must enter y or n` whenever you enter something other than those two values.\n",
    "1. It stoped program right at that time, but I modify program to add else code\n",
